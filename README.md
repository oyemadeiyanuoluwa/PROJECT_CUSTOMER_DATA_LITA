  ### Recommendations
  - Implement customer retention strategies to stabilize both active and inactive subscriptions, especially in underperforming regions like the East.
  - Given that Basic is the most popular subscription type, consider expanding its availability or introducing additional features to further boost sales, especially in regions where it 
    is underrepresented.
  - Given the drop in sales from 2022 to 2023, assess market shifts or external factors that may have impacted performance and adjust strategies to improve sales for the coming year.
 
### Limitations
- Some values were missing, which limited the ability to conduct a thorough analysis of the customer data.

### Conclusions
- To address the sales decline, it's important to identify the causes, especially towards the end of the year, and implement strategies like seasonal promotions and loyalty programs to 
  maintain momentum. Focusing on customer retention and re-engagement will help stabilize both active and inactive subscriptions, particularly in underperforming regions like the East.

- By leveraging the strong performance in the North Region, targeted campaigns can be used to boost subscriptions in other areas. Expanding the popular Basic subscription and 
  considering new features will help increase sales, particularly in regions where itâ€™s underrepresented.
